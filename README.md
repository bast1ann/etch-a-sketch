# Etch a Sketch
In this project I'm going to build a game where you can draw clicking with your mouse on a canvas made from pixels, the which can be customizable and change the canvas size. 

This project is part from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch) and is made to show my new knowledge on DOM Manipulation.
